# fogg FAQ

## Where did the name come from?

When looking for a name we searched for people and things related to the concept of terraforming planets, which led us to [Martyn Fogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyn_J._Fogg). 'Fogg' seemed like a nice short name, and there didn't appear to be other software with this name. So here we are.

## What is sicc?

SICC was a predecessor to fogg that we used only internally at CZI.
